    % Explanation: Scrabble is a famous board game which is based on natural language processing and word completion and therefore may be played by artificial non-human players that make use of algorithms based on \ac{AI}. The following work aims to extend a partly existing Scrabble computer game in the following ways:

    % First, the existing implementation is extended to allow two non-human players to play against each other.

    % Secondly, one of the two non-human players abstracts different algorithms for choosing Scrabble moves, which are implemented within this work.

    % Thirdly, this work compares the implemented algorithms with regards to their quality, based on performance indicators which are defined throughout this work.
